This project introduces SoundLIME or SLIME, an algorithm to explain the predictions of music content analysis systems. The repository contains the code, and configuration files to reproduce the results reported in our ISMIR 2017 submission. Two versions of explanations (temporal and time-frequency) can be generated using the repository code. Details about the constituents of each sub-directory and how to generate instance-based explanations is provided in the "Readme" file located at each sub-directory.
